# OthelloBoardGame
An implementation of the classic board game Othello (also known as Reversi) in Python, featuring an AI player utilizing the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.

Project Features:
-Interactive Gameplay: Players can click to place their discs on the board, with real-time updates and automatic disc flipping according to the rules of Othello.
-Smart AI Opponent: The computer opponent uses the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make strategic moves, providing a challenging and competitive gameplay experience.
-Dynamic Score Display: The game keeps track of the scores for both players, updating in real-time as discs are placed and flipped.
-Game Over Detection: The game identifies when no more valid moves are possible or when the board is full, displaying a game-over message and the final scores.
-Easy Restart: Players can restart the game anytime by pressing the spacebar, allowing for continuous play without restarting the application.

Technologies Used:
-Python: The core programming language for the game logic and AI implementation.
-Pygame: Used for rendering the game graphics, handling user input, and managing the game loop.
